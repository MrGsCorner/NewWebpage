<h2> The Teacher's Corner </h2>


<p> Personal Information:
One of my hobbies is working out with weights and walking as I push my grandson in his stroller. In my spare time (not much of that), I like to listen to music, sing karaoke, ride my motorcycle, and read. I love riding motorcycles! As for reading, I love reading about American History, Politics, and crazy mysteries are a must! Oh, I love to cook! I am a Junior Master Chef!  </p>

My wife and I celebrated our 30th anniversary on August 15, 2022. We have two daughters (a 26-year-old & 18-year-old). Four dogs named Buster Brown, Ellie Mae, Izzy Pop, and Motley Crue, and three cats named Circuit, Bella, and Orange Kitty, 19 years old.

<h3>Personal Technology Statement for the Classroom</h3>

<p> 
	A year after the release of the 2016 National Education Technology Plan (NETP), sweeping change has occurred across the country. Increased classroom broadband has changed the teaching and learning environments for the better. These changes have led school leaders to emphasize educational technology issues, data security, digital citizenship, and preparing teachers with the technological skills needed to teach learners before they arrive in the classroom. Previously, the NETP updated technology cycles every five years but soon realized this was not frequent enough. Changes began in 2017 that guarantee yearly changes will be made so that schools can provide better technological tools inside and outside the classroom. Technology can improve learning at all levels, regardless of people's backgrounds or locations. It enhances communication between users, allows users to share, and helps improve both teaching and learning practices. As a result, technology now empowers student learning through engagement, assisting teachers in improving teaching using technology and creating a culture of innovative leadership (U.S. Department of Education http://tech.ed.gov.,2017).</p>   
<p?Technology empowers student learning: Technology tools such as discussion forums help lower- and higher-level critical thinking skills. Discussion forums allow students to communicate with their peers, answer questions requiring critical thinking skills, and analyze that given content. Through clear guidelines, participation in discussion forums will enable students to demonstrate the process of engaging in critical thinking. For example, in Canvas, the discussion feature allows teachers to pose debate questions on a discussion board. Students would then support their side using references to support their argument(s). Peer review activities also empower students because they must engage in communication and provide feedback to other classmates (s). Students who participate in such activities using the online format are more likely to share their opinions with others because they know they can remain anonymous. This empowers some students who, if placed in a classroom setting, may have just kept quiet because they were afraid to voice their opinions. Small group activities also empower students in the learning process. These activities allow students to communicate, hear several perspectives, collaborate to analyze and synthesize content, and solve problems. Doing so makes students more likely to use their critical thinking skills (Using technology to develop students' critical thinking skills., 2020, September 23).</p>
<p>Technology helps teachers improve teaching: Technology connects educators to data, content, people, resources, and learning experiences that can inspire and empower them and be more effective teachers. Instead of just focusing on classroom teaching, teachers can collaborate with the global teaching and learning community. These communities include museums, libraries after school programs, and experts in various fields worldwide. Through collaborating with students, other teachers, members of community organizations, and families, teachers gain access to a plethora of instructional materials and resources that help them create, manage, and assess what they are teaching to students. Teachers are not restricted to collaborating with fellow educators within their building. This global community allows them to expand their perspectives and create real-world opportunities for student learning. All of these elements help teachers make student learning more authentic and relevant. Using tools like video conferencing, social media sites, and online charts, educators worldwide help support student learning (U.S. Department of Education http://tech.ed.gov.,2017).</p> 
<p>Technology helps create a culture of innovative leadership: A report published by the Institute and Dell Technologies in 2018, an estimated 85% of children entering the public school system will find themselves in jobs that currently do not exist. Some schools are exploring the new educational landscape called gamification. Gamification is used in modern environments to engage students in a culture of innovative learning. Gamification may be added to any lesson or activity a teacher uses. It allows students to add game-like qualities to an existing task or activity. It helps meet students by engaging in what they know, but they become innovative as they learn new concepts and skills (What is Gamification, and why is it trending in K–12 schools?, 2022, August 23). However, transforming learning by using technology requires a community that has a shared vision. Technology helps the process of making changes that are best for everyone involved. Once a shared vision is established, technology opens up new possibilities to accomplish the shared vision by everyone through a collaborative effort. This creates a culture where innovation is a priority to keep up with the ever-changing world of technology. Student learning can also be personalized to ensure all student needs are met. Active and collaborative learning activities using technology will ensure that all student needs are met (U.S. Department of Education http://tech.ed.gov.,2017).</p>    
<p>The changes that began in 2017 yearly guarantee changes will be made so that schools can provide better technological tools inside and outside the classroom. Technology does improve learning at all levels, regardless of people's backgrounds or locations. It enhances communication between users, allows users to share, and helps improve both teaching and learning practices. Technology empowers student learning, assists teachers in improving teaching, and creates a culture of innovative leadership (U.S. Department of Education http://tech.ed.gov.,2017).</p>
